# Netflix-Movie-Analysis
With millions of subscribers, Netflix is one of the world's top streaming platform, offering a wide selection of movies and TV shows. The dataset exampined is the project was sourced form Kaggle, a popular site for data science projects and contests. This dataset includes vaiables such as show_id, type, title,director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating,duration, listed_in, description. These factors give a thorough picture of Netflix's collection, which makes it perfect for examining trends in genres, length preferences, and ratings over time.
The dataset presents interesting analytic possibilities. One intriguing question is: How do Netflix's movie ratings represent the platform's user preferences over time, and what trends can be seen in them? By investigating this issue, I hope to find trends in Netflix's focus on particular ratings, changes in the variety of genres, and whether the service gives preference to shorter or longer movies in order to satisfy user preferences. This study will clarify how Netflix carefully selects its collection in order to maintain its competitiveness in the streaming market.
